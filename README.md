# OpticalTweezerNet
Here we propose a residual neural network (ResNet) to characterize the size of optically trapped nanoparticles based on temporally undersampled position measurements acquired by a camera with limited detection bandwith. Using the time series measurements of the position of a single particle in traps with both strong and weak stiffnesses, this work tests the performance of the ResNet in accurately determining particle size.
